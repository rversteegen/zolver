### Instruction
Please translate the following problem statements into a computer algebra system using patterns from the following lookup table:
• greatest common divisor of x and y → gcd(x, y)
• least common multiple of x and y → gcd(x, y)
• x choose y combinations → comb(x, y)
• x is a real unknown → x = variable()
• x is an integer unknown → x = variable(integer = True)
• x_i is an infinite sequence → x = seq()
• x_i is a sequence for i ∈ 1, …, 32 → x = seq(limit = 32)
• 1, …, 32 → range(1, 32)
• x_i → x[i]
• sum of x_i for i ∈ S → sum(x, S)
• a = b → a == b
• the sequence of digits of x in base b → digits(x, b)
• sum of x_i for i ∈ S → sum(x, S)
• the set of x such that r holds → set(x, r)
• for i ∈ S, e → for(i, S, e)
• for i such that constraint r holds, e → for(i, r, e)
• equation or relation r is a constraint → constraint(r 
• x is positive → constraint(x > 0)
• x is prime → constraint(prime(x))
• x is the smallest value in S → constraint(x == min(S))
• the largest possible value of x → max(x)
• the size of set S → max(S)
• the number of possible solutions of relation r → count(r)
• the number of possible values of x such that r holds → count(r, x)
• find x → goal = x

### Statement
"When the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two integers are multiplied, the product is 180. How many different values could be the greatest common divisor of the two integers?"

### Translation
```
a = variable(integer = True)
b = variable(integer = True)
constraint(gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) == 180)
goal = count(gcd(a, b))
```

### Statement
"What is the first natural number after 42 that has a remainder of $5$ when divided by $7?"

### Translation
```
a = variable(natural = True)
constraint(a > 42)
constraint(a % 7 == 5)
goal = min(a)
```

### Statement
"A geometric sequence starts with $a_1 = 2$. If $a_4 = 6$ what is $a_9$?""

### Translation
```
a = seq()
r = variable()
i = variable(integer = True)
for(i, i > 1, a[i] == r * a[i - 1])
constraint(a[1] == 2)
constraint(a[4] == 6)
goal = a[9]
```
